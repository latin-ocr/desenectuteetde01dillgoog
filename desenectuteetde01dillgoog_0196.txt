“1 rejoice to perceive that your efforts are continued in thia mont
important field of literary iabor- Few worka need judicioue notee
more than thie one, (Cicero de Oratore 5) and for want of them and in
consequence of the very inferior editione which have been publiahed
in thie country heretosore, 1 believe it hae been read much leen than lt
aenerves. 1 have no doubt that it will supersede ali the other forms in
which thie treatioe hae been presented to the public, and 1 shall feel it -
my duty to recommend it whenever it may be in my ,power.'’

‘¹ We have given to the present work (De Senectute et de Amicitia)
nome examination‚ and cannot refrain stom expreasin high approba·
tion of the manner ln which the editor has personne hie important
tark. Tne most difficult part os his labor was the preparation ot· the
Noten- Thia he hae executed with great akill, accuracy‚ and ‚iud ent.
. . . . Mr. Dillaway in particularly well fitted for the work e hae
undertaken, having had ample experience aa instructor in the first
clauical echool in our country.”

‘⁸ This ie a very neat edition of Cicero’e treatiae De Officiis. The
text ie printed in a clear, handaome type, leaded, and ao divided into
sections and marked withfl ree along the margin, aa to make the
book convenient for recitat one. The English notes of, the editor
appear to be correct and judicioua, affordlng Just the kind os aid which
the studente need, without encumbering them with help. The same
editor hae pubiiehed similar editione of Cicero’s book De Oratore and
of the beautiful little eseays De Senectute et de Amicitia ..... ’ῘἮθεο
books are evidences of a widely-spread tacte for classica! learning, and
they are well adapted to foster it. Believin that a judicious study of
the classice is a vaiuabie meane ot‘ mental discipline, and ie capable
under the direction of a wine teacher, of being made an instrument of

moral instruction we look with pieaaure on every indication of ι
growing love for the etudy.”
