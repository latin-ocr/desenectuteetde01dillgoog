NOTES. 14⁷

81. 10. Δᾶεοὺσαπίᾳηε eibi.- “seek an intimate ac-
quaintance with them.”

81. 19. Quae . . . . abhorreret. Melmoth thinks
that Cicero refers in this passage to a custom which
prevailed in Rome, by which the general, whose
arms had made any new acquisition of territory to
the republic, was the declared patron of those people
whom he had subdued. These were afterwards
considered as the hereditary clients of his family, to
the head of which they constantly had recourse, as
their standing advocate, in all those causes of a na-
tional concern which they had occasion to plead

before the senate.
82. 5. mm . . . . amicis.- “that our fi-iends

‚should have no wants to which we may administer.”

Suc. XV. Nothing more ‚valuable than friend-
ship: fortune often a bar to fidelity in it.

82. 11. Nec usu nec ratione: “neither by experi-
ence‚” (for they can neither love nor be loved sin·
cerely,) “ nor by instruction.”

82. 19. Smpeda atque sollicita. It is said of
Dionysius of Syracuse, that he would not admit his
wife or children to his apartment, without a previous
examination of their garments 3 nor would he suffer
even his children to trim his heard, so suspicious
had he become on account of the hatred the people
manifesoed of his tyranny.

82. 22. simulatione .- “ under the semblance of
pomonal attachment?
