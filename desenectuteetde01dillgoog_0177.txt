come before him in his judicial capacity,” says
Cicero, “he is no longer to consider himself in the
character of a fiand, but of a magistrate, who is
solemnly sworn to give sentence according to evi-
dence3 and the only favor he can justifiably show,
is to appoint the trial, in consequence of the discre-
tionary power with which he is invested by the
laws, at the time which may be most convenient to
his friend. But when he appears as an advocate,
he is under much less restraint. He may support
the cause of his friend, provided his crime be not
of a very atrocious nature, without any impeach-
ment of his own integrity3 and in this he acts agree-
ably, not only to the general practice and expectation
of the world, but to the common dictates of human-
ity. The judge, indeed, must strictly and invariably
be governed by nuth, as sar as he can discover it, in
every question that comes before him3 but the advo-
cate may be permitted to give a plausible coloring
to the fact in charge, and place it in the most advan-
tageous, though it should not be in its proper light.
And this is a doctrine,'’ continues Cicero, “which
1 would not venture to advance, especially in a
neatise on ethics, if Ι were not supported in it by
the authority of Panaetius, one of the most judicious

¹ and respectable writers among the Stoic philoso-

phers.” Cicero acted agreeably to this doctrine in
his defence of Milo, as he knew it was Milo’s inten-

tion to kill Clodius, if he met him on his way to

Lanuvium.
