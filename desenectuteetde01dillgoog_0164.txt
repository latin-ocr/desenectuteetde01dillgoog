136 NOTES.

honored by the noblest and most unquestionable of
all panegyrics3 sor it was delivered from the mouth
osa man who had always been in the number of his
political enemieS‚ and was himself esteemed one of
the principal ornaments of his ti'me. “Go,'’ says
Metellus, addressing himself to his sons, “go and
attend the funeral qs Scipio, sor never will you follow
the remaim qs a greater man.”

· 60. 22. Paucorum annorum accessio. Scipio died
at the age of fisty-six.

61. 1. Moriendi . . . . videtis: “the sudden-
ness of his death deprived it of any sensible degree
of pain; what was the cause os his death, it is diffi-
eult to tell; what men suspect, you well know.”
Scipio was found dead in his bed, those who in-
quired for the causes of his sudden decease, per-

. ceived the marks of violence on his neck, and

concluded that he had been strangled. This hap-
pened 128 years before Christ. It was generally
believed that this assassination was committed by
the Triumviri‚ Papirius Carbo, Caius Gracchus,
and Fulvius FlaceuS‚ who supported the Sempro-
nian law, and by his wife Sempronia, who is
charged with having introduced the murderers into
the room. No inquiries were made aster the au-
thors of his death3 Gracchus was the favor-ite of
the mob, and the only atonement which the popu-
lace made for the death of Scipi0, was to attend his
funeral, and to show their concern by their eries and

lamentationes.
