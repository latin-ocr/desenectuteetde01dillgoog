86. 18.· Negligenda est sama ,· sc. propter andem
We must not be guilty of an iufamous action to
benefit our friends, sor that would bring upon us the
contempt of mankind, and we should be injured
more than our friends would be profited.

86. 18. Nec . . . . avium.- “nor ought the gen-
eral affection of our fellow-citizens to be considered
os little importance in the management of our affairs?

volving but a smallsum of money.”

87. 24. Se obscuratum iri.- “ that they will dazzle
the eyes of observers.”

87. 26. Itaque . . . . versantur. Epaminondas and
Pelopidas may be considered among the rare in·
stances here mentioned. There is nothing, indeed,
more to be admired in the character of these illus-
trious supports and ornaments of the Theban com-
monwealth, than that perfect union and constant
’ friendship which subsistet] between them during
their joint direction of public affairs both in peace

and war. If we shall observe, says Plutarch, what ⁸

happened in the same situation between Aristides
and ThemistocleS, Cimon and Periclea, Nicias and
Alcibiades, we shall find their administratione full
of tumult, conten-tinus, and disputes.
88. 2. calamitatum societates .· “ a participationi
